# Experiment 2 (notes)
---

* Maximum Probabilistic model 
* Probability = same as experiment 1
* Only difference is that, if illegal syllable is found in syllabification permutation, then its score is made zero forcefully.
* These probabilities are pre-computed and stored in directory for model_files/

###Results
---

##### Without Prefix - Suffix 

* Correct Words: 5758  / 6491  (88.70 %)
* Correct Chars: 34324 / 35444 (96.84 %)

##### With Prefix - Suffix 

* Correct Words: 5988  / 6491  (92.25 %)
* Correct Chars: 34666 / 35444 (97.80 %)

###Observations

* Best possible probabilistic model yet.
